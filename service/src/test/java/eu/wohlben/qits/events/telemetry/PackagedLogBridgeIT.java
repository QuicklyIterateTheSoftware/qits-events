/**
 * The log bridge on the <em>packaged artifact</em> — the fast-jar under {@code ./mvnw verify
 * -DskipITs=false}, the GraalVM binary under {@code -Dnative}.
 *
 * <p>{@link OtelLogBridgeTest} proves the bridge in the build JVM, and that is not enough to ship
 * on. Every platform service runs as a native image, and the two things this proof depends on are
 * exactly the two a native image can lose: a log <b>handler</b> installed during the extension's
 * runtime initialisation, and an <b>exporter</b> that marshals protobuf and opens a connection. Both
 * are build-time-sensitive, both are invisible to a {@code @QuarkusTest} — which augments in the
 * build JVM with the whole classpath present — and a binary that dropped either would start
 * cleanly, serve every request and log nothing anywhere but its own console.
 *
 * <p>It also runs the <b>shipped</b> configuration rather than the suite's: the launched process
 * takes the {@code prod} profile, so {@code %test.quarkus.otel.sdk.disabled=true} does not apply and
 * the four {@code quarkus.otel.logs.*} keys in {@code application.properties} are what is under
 * test. Only the endpoint is redirected, at {@link OtlpLogStub}, whose base carries qits'
 * non-default {@code /observability/api/otel} prefix so that the SDK's {@code /v1/logs} suffixing is
 * exercised too.
 *
 * <p>The two records it asserts on are ones the <em>shipped</em> code produces, because a fixture
 * class in {@code src/test} is not in the artifact:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Quarkus' own startup line, an ordinary INFO record through the same JBoss Log Manager every
 *       application logger uses;
 *   <li>a genuine unhandled server error, which is the shape that matters most — an ERROR with a
 *       throwable, raised inside a request, which is what an operator goes looking for.
 * </ul>
