/**
 * The other half of the log-bridge proof: what shipping logs costs when nothing is listening.
 *
 * <p>The design's one non-negotiable is that logging must never make this service's availability
 * depend on qits-observability. So the acceptance test for an unreachable receiver is not "every log
 * is eventually delivered" — it cannot be, and pretending otherwise is how an in-process queue grows
 * without bound. It is: <b>the process starts, answers requests and stays bounded while every export
 * fails.</b>
 *
 * <p>The exporter points at {@code http://127.0.0.1:1} — a closed port on the loopback, so the
 * failure is an immediate connection refusal rather than a timeout the suite would wait out. That
 * the application under test <em>starts at all</em> under this profile is the first assertion and it
 * is made by the class existing: a bridge that treated its receiver as a dependency would fail here
 * before a test method ran.
 *
 * <p>Bounded memory is asserted as far as it is observable from outside, and no further. The SDK's
 * batch processor holds a fixed-capacity queue ({@code quarkus.otel.blrp.max.queue.size}, 2048 by
 * default) and drops rather than grows once it is full; what a test can honestly see is that far
 * more records than that can be emitted without the caller ever blocking and without the service
 * ceasing to answer. Reaching inside for a queue depth would assert the SDK's internals rather than
 * qits' requirement.
